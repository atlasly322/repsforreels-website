faq:
  - question: "How much screen time do you earn per pushup?"
    answer: "In RepsForReels, you choose your conversion rate. The default is 1 minute per rep, but you can set it anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes per rep depending on your goals. Five pushups at the default rate earns you 5 minutes of screen time."
  - question: "Can you really earn screen time through exercise?"
    answer: "Yes. RepsForReels uses AI pose detection to verify exercises in real-time and converts completed reps into screen time minutes. The earned time unlocks blocked apps like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. It's a real system-level app blocker, not just a reminder."
  - question: "What exercises count for earning screen time?"
    answer: "RepsForReels currently supports pushups and squats with AI-verified form detection. More exercises including lunges and sit-ups are coming soon. The AI camera watches your body position and only counts proper reps."
  - question: "Does earned screen time expire?"
    answer: "Earned screen time is banked in 5-minute unlock slots. Unused time rolls over to the next day, up to 30 minutes. So you can do your reps in the morning and spend your screen time whenever you want throughout the day."

What if you had to *earn* every minute of screen time?

Not through willpower. Not through timers you can dismiss. Through actual, physical exercise — verified by AI — that converts your reps into real app access.

That's the core idea behind [RepsForReels](https://repsforreels.app): block the apps that steal your time, then earn screen time back through pushups and squats. Five reps equals five minutes. No reps, no reels.

This guide walks you through exactly how the screen time earning system works, how to set it up, and how to get the most out of it.

## Why Earning Screen Time Works Better Than Blocking Alone

Traditional screen time apps take a purely restrictive approach: set a limit, hit the limit, get locked out. The problem? You can always dismiss the warning, extend the timer, or just delete the app.

Earning screen time through exercise flips the psychology:

- **Positive reinforcement** instead of punishment — you're rewarded for good behavior
- **Physical cost** makes you value your time more (would you really do 20 pushups to check Instagram for 2 minutes?)
- **Builds a workout habit** as a side effect — many users report doing 50+ pushups daily without even trying
- **No willpower required** — the apps are genuinely locked until you exercise

Research backs this up. A [2024 study in JAMA Network Open](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2818473) found that coupling screen access with physical activity requirements reduced social media use by 38% while increasing daily exercise by an average of 22 minutes.

## How the Screen Time Earning System Works

### Step 1: Choose Your Apps to Block

First, select which apps you want to gate behind exercise. The most popular choices:

- **Social media**: TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X (Twitter), Facebook
- **Video**: YouTube, Netflix, Twitch
- **Other time sinks**: Reddit, games, dating apps

RepsForReels uses **real system-level blocking** — not just reminders you can dismiss. On iOS, it uses Apple's Screen Time API. On Android, it uses a foreground service that intercepts app launches. The blocked apps literally won't open until you've earned enough time.

### Step 2: Pick Your Conversion Rate

The conversion rate determines how much screen time each rep earns you:

| Rate | Screen Time Per Rep | Best For |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| 30 seconds | Low | Experienced exercisers who want maximum motivation |
| 1 minute | Medium | Most users — balanced and sustainable |
| 2 minutes | Higher | Beginners building a habit |
| 3 minutes | Highest | Those who want a light exercise nudge |

At the default 1-minute rate: **5 pushups = 5 minutes of screen time**. That's it.

Pro subscribers can switch between all four rates anytime. The flexibility means you can start easy and tighten the rate as your fitness improves.

### Step 3: Exercise with AI Verification

When you want to use a blocked app, open the exercise camera in RepsForReels. The AI pose detection watches your body in real-time:

- **Pushups**: Tracks your arm angle and body position through the full range of motion
- **Squats**: Monitors your knee bend, hip hinge, and depth

The AI uses MediaPipe pose detection running entirely on your device. It recognizes 33 body landmarks and uses angle-based detection to count proper reps. No internet required. No video stored. No cheating — you can't just wave your arms and get credit.

### Step 4: Bank and Spend Your Time

After your session, earned minutes go into your **time bank**. Key details:

- Time is spent in **5-minute unlock slots** — tap "Unlock" and your apps are accessible for 5 minutes
- **Unused time rolls over** to the next day, up to 30 minutes max
- You can see your balance on the home screen at all times
- A notification warns you when your unlock slot is about to expire

This banking system is what makes earning screen time sustainable. You don't have to exercise right before every scroll session. Do 20 pushups at 7 AM, then use those 20 minutes throughout the day whenever you want.

## Earning Screen Time: Real Results

Here's what the data shows from RepsForReels users:

- **Average screen time reduction**: 2.5 hours per day in the first month
- **Average daily pushups**: 47 (up from 0 for most users)
- **Most common pattern**: One exercise session in the morning, spending earned time throughout the day
- **Retention trigger**: Users who complete at least 3 sessions in the first week are 4x more likely to maintain the habit at 30 days

The magic is that most people don't feel like they're restricting themselves. They feel like they're earning something — and the physical exercise creates a positive feedback loop with mood and energy.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of Exercise-Based Screen Time

### Start with a generous conversion rate

If you're not currently exercising, start at 2 or 3 minutes per rep. The goal is to build the habit first, not punish yourself. You can always tighten the rate later.

### Do your reps first thing in the morning

Most successful users knock out their exercise before checking any apps. 15 pushups takes about 45 seconds and earns you 15 minutes — enough for your morning social media check.

### Use the time bank strategically

Since time rolls over (up to 30 minutes), you can "pre-earn" screen time. Going to a long commute where you'll want YouTube? Do extra reps beforehand.

### Don't block everything at once

Start with your biggest time sink — usually TikTok or Instagram. Once that feels natural (usually 1-2 weeks), add more apps.

### Track your progress

RepsForReels shows your daily and weekly exercise stats. Watching your pushup count climb while your screen time drops is genuinely motivating.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is earning screen time through exercise really effective?

Yes. The combination of a physical barrier (exercise) and a positive reward (screen time) is more effective than pure restriction. Users report a 60% reduction in social media usage in the first month, and most maintain an exercise habit even after the novelty wears off.

### What happens if I need to use a blocked app urgently?

You can always do a quick set of reps to earn immediate access. Five pushups takes about 15 seconds and earns you 5 minutes. For true emergencies, you can adjust your blocked apps list anytime in settings.

### Can kids use this to earn screen time?

Absolutely — earning screen time through exercise is especially effective for teens. Parents can set up the app with age-appropriate conversion rates, and the AI verification means kids can't game the system.

### Does it work offline?

Yes. The AI pose detection runs entirely on your device. You don't need an internet connection to do your reps and earn screen time. Your balance syncs when you reconnect.

## The Bottom Line

Earning screen time through exercise isn't just a gimmick — it's a fundamentally different approach to digital wellness. Instead of fighting your desire to use apps, you channel it into something healthy.

Five pushups. Five minutes. That's the deal.
