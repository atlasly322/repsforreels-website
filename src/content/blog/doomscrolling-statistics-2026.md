## What These Numbers Mean For You

Let me put these statistics in personal terms:

**If you're average**, you're spending 70 days per year on your phone. That's nearly 20% of your waking life.

**If you're Gen Z**, there's an 82% chance you already know you have a problem — and a 72% chance you believe your mental health would improve if apps were less addictive.

**If you spend 5+ hours daily** on your phone, you're 71% more likely to experience mental health challenges compared to someone who uses their phone for 1 hour.

These aren't scare tactics. These are peer-reviewed statistics.

The question isn't whether screen time addiction is real — the data proves it is. The question is: what are you going to do about it?

## Take Action

Knowledge without action is just entertainment (which is ironic given the topic).

Here are three things you can do today:

1. **Check your actual screen time** — Go to Settings → Screen Time (iOS) or Digital Wellbeing (Android). See your real numbers.

2. **Identify your worst offender** — Which app consumes the most time? That's your target.

3. **Try one intervention** — Whether it's an app like [RepsForReels](/), a manual rule like "10 pushups before opening Instagram," or just deleting the app entirely — try ONE thing.

The statistics say most of us have a problem. But statistics also show that people are actively trying to change.

Be part of that second statistic.
